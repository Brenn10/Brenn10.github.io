            <h2>The program</h2>
            <p>
                The Beaver Works Summer Institue (BWSI) began as an idea by Dr. Robert "Bob" Shin of MIT Lincoln Labs to create a summer program for programmers, an area that was previously undeveloped. His goal was to create a program where high school students from around the United States could work together with top researchers and professionals in the field of robotics to develop autonomous robotics systems. In order to find students for the pilot year of BWSI, Dr. Shin contacted the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS) and was able to find students from many of the member schools. Students came from 10 states: Mississippi, Illinois, Arkansas, California, New York, Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Massachuessets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program lasted for 4 weeks. The students worked each weekday from 9:00am to 5:00pm. During the weekdays, the students listened to lectures and seminars and worked on labs to enforce the material and accomplish weekly goals. On Tuesdays and Thursdays teh students would also attend a lesson on communication with Dr. Jane Connor. Each week, the students were given a section of robotics to learn and a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 1 focused on the basics of the basics of the Robot Operating System (ROS), Linux (Ubuntu), and Python. The challenge for the week was to make the robot follow the wall using the Lidar.
