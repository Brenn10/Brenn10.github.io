            <h1 id="overview">The program</h1>
            <p>
                The Beaver Works Summer Institue (BWSI) began as an idea by Dr. Robert "Bob" Shin of MIT Lincoln Labs to create a summer program for programmers, an area that was previously undeveloped. His goal was to create a program where high school students from around the United States could work together with top researchers and professionals in the field of robotics to develop autonomous robotics systems. In order to find students for the pilot year of BWSI, Dr. Shin contacted the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS) and was able to find students from many of the member schools. Students came from 10 states: Mississippi, Illinois, Arkansas, California, New York, Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Massachuessets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program lasted for 4 weeks. The students worked each weekday from 9:00am to 5:00pm. During the weekdays, the students listened to lectures and seminars and worked on labs to enforce the material and accomplish weekly goals. On Tuesdays and Thursdays teh students would also attend a lesson on communication with Dr. Jane Connor. Each week, the students were given a section of robotics to learn and a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 1 focused on the basics of the basics of the Robot Operating System (ROS), Linux (Ubuntu), and Python. The challenge for the week was to make the robot follow the wall using the Lidar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 2 focused on image processing and recognition (manipulating and matching images). The challenge for the week was to visual servo (approach using visual input for steering) to a target on the wall and decide which direction to turn based on which color, red or green, is present.
            </p>
            <p>
                Week 3 was intended to be focused on localization and mapping, however, several technical issues led to a focus on the technical challenges instead. These challenges included exploring and detecting colored blobs and completing a correct turn at a colored piece of paper.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                There were several goals for week 1. The first goal was to level the playing field for all students by reteaching everything from the summer work. The next goal was to learn how to use the lidar to interpret the environment and follow a wall.
            </p>
            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>
                The first day of the program was intended to explain the basics of the cars we were using. The Jetson TX1 is the processor we used. This is a special processor with hundreds of cores that allow for fast parallel processing. ROS is based upon the idea of parallel processing and, as such, works well with the Jetson. We decided to use a special distribution of Ubuntu for the Jetson. ROS runs on Linux and Ubuntu is a very easy version to use. On top of the cars are wireless routers that allow the robot and our computers to connect to each other and the internet. An electronic speed controller (VESC) is used to control the driving speed and steering angle of the robot. A passive stereo camera is used to sense depth and input images. A lidar is used to perceive distances in a horizontal plane in a 270&deg; angle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next day we learned about the basics of Linux, Python, ROS, and robotics. We learned the basics of the Linux shell, Python syntax and tricks, ROS topics and nodes, and robotic architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kyle Edelberg taught on control systems and how he used them at the MIT Jet Propulsion Lab in California (JPL). In his work at JPL, he learned to use proportional, differential, and integral controllers (PID controllers). PID controllers work by first having a way of defining an error. This error is passed into the PID controller and a steering command is output. The controller has three parts. Proportional is the part that points the car toward the way to reduce the error. Derivative uses the change in the error to slow the acceleration toward the point of no error. This effectively prevents destructive oscillatory motion and overshooting. The integral portion prevent steady state error. These are errors that persist and the robot cannot correct for. They are removed by keeping a tally of the errors over a frame of time.
            </p>
            <h2>Labs</h2>
            <p>
                We connected to the cars and learned how to publish topics. Topics are channels of communication between nodes that allow for easy transfer of data. Nodes are individual parts of a robot such as a sensor, motor, controller, or output device.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ran nodes to demonstrate communication between ros nodes. We also learned how to simulate a physical environment using the gazebo simulator.
            </p>
            <p>
                We used rviz to see the output from sensors on the robot and rosbagged all topics in order to understand what happens when the robot runs. Rosbag is a command in ROS that saves data published to topics in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team implemented a Bang-Bang(BB) controller and a PD (Proportional and Differential) controller. BB controllers are essentially binary controllers. If the car is too close, the BB will push the car full in the opposite direction and vice-versa if the car is too far. The controller has two states: full left and full right. PID controllers adjust to the error in a controlled manner that prevents large switches and inefficiencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithm for the PD controller was implemented in the following way:
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/Brenn10/4d3cec6b890f40b3e6ab8ff2bed7a501.js"></script>
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The team implemented a wall follower that could switch which wall was being followed using a gamepad. This program used the shortest distance from the robot to the wall in a range of the laser scan to find the error. This error was then fed in to the PD controller which determined the steering angle for the car to drive. The team placed 4th in the first round with a time of 8.645s [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12sjPkcfbD6K2bD13X8J90o-6XzXjV5yAjKpmQWqVzgc/edit?usp=sharing]. In the drag races, we progressed past the first round to be defeated by the “Fastest Loser” in the second round. The team dynamic was very healthy and enjoyable. We all learned how to deal with others' opinions and criticisms. We chose each other when were allowed to choose teams for the final weeks.

            <h1 id="week2">Week 2</h1>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The goals for week 2 were to be able to use blob detection, visual servo toward a blob, and recognize different colored blobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blobs are colored swatches. Contour has a similar meaning, a contour is an area of a similar color of an area that has fit inside a ceratin criteria. We used pieces of paper for the blobs. Visual servoing is following a blob toward a target.
