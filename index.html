            <h2>The program</h2>
            <p>	
                The Beaver Works Summer Institute was created to supply an 
                engineering program for high school students. The program was 
                envisioned and created by Dr. Robert “Bob” Shin, Head of the 
                Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and 
                Tactical Systems Division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory
                <a href="references.html#1">[1]</a>. His vision for this project
                was to allow high school seniors to have a summer camp that 
                could be brought back to their home high schools.<br>
                The ultimate goal for this class over the 4 weeks of lectures, 
                seminars, and labs was to learn to program robots using Robot 
                Operating System (ROS). Each week there was a challenge for each 
                team to accomplish. These events related to what was learned in 
                the previous week. Week one focused on the lidar, a radar system 
                based on visible light, for measuring distance. Week two focused
                on OpenCV perception and blob detection. Week 3 was intended to 
                be localization, however, it instead turned to exploration. Week 
                4, the final week, was focused on preparing for the final 
                challenges and race.
