            <h1>Week One</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>There were several goals for week 1. The first goal was to level 
                the playing field for all students by reteaching everything from
                the summer work. The next goal was to learn how to use the lidar 
                to interpret the environment and follow a wall.
            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>The first day of the program was intended to explain the basics 
                of the cars we were using. The Jetson TX1 is the processor we 
                used. This is a special processor with hundreds of cores that 
                allow for fast parallel processing. ROS is based upon the idea 
                of parallel processing and, as such, works well with the Jetson.
                We decided to use a special distribution of Ubuntu for the 
                Jetson. ROS runs on Linux and Ubuntu is a very easy version to 
                use. On top of the cars are wireless routers that allow the 
                robot and our computers to connect to each other and the 
                internet. An electronic speed controller (VESC) is used to 
                control the driving speed and steering angle of the robot. A 
                passive stereo camera is used to sense depth and input images. 
                A lidar is used to perceive distances in a horizontal plane in 
                a 270&deg; angle.</p>
            <p>The next day we learned about the basics of Linux, Python, ROS, 
                and robotics. We learned the basics of the Linux shell, Python 
                syntax and tricks, ROS topics and nodes, and robotic 
                architecture. </p>
            <p>Kyle Edelberg taught on control systems and how he used them at 
                the MIT Jet Propulsion Lab in California(JPL). In his work at 
                JPL, he learned to use proportional, differential, and integral
                controllers (PID controllers). PID controllers work by first 
                having a way of defining an error. This error is passed into the
                PID controller and a steering command is output. The controller 
                has three parts. Proportional is the part that points the car 
                toward the way to reduce the error. Derivative uses the change 
                in the error to slow the acceleration toward the point of no 
                error. This effectively prevents destructive oscillatory motion 
                and overshooting. The integral portion prevent steady state 
                error. These are errors that persist and the robot cannot 
                correct for. They are removed by keeping a tally of the errors 
                over a frame of time.</p>
            <h2>Labs</h2>
            <p>We connected to the cars and learned how to publish topics. 
                Topics are channels of communication between nodes that allow 
                for easy transfer of data. Nodes are individual parts of a robot 
                such as a sensor, motor, controller, or output device.</p>
            <p>We ran nodes to demonstrate communication between ros nodes. We 
                also learned how to simulate a physical environment using the 
                gazebo simulator.</p>
            <p>We used rviz to see the output from sensors on the robot and 
                rosbagged all topics in order to understand what happens when 
                the robot runs. Rosbag is a command in ROS that saves data 
                published to topics in real time.</p>
            <p>The team implemented a Bang-Bang(BB) controller and a PID 
                controller. BB controllers are essentially binary controllers. If the car is too close, the BB will push the car full in the opposite direction and vice-versa if the car is too far. The controller has two states: full left and full right. PID contr
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The team implemented a wall follower that could switch which wall 
                was being followed using a gamepad. This program used the 
                shortest distance from the robot to the wall in a range of the 
                laser scan to find the error. This error was then fed in to the 
                PID controller which determined the steering angle for the car 
                to drive. The team placed 4th in the first round with a time of 
                8.645s<a href="references.html#2">[2]</a>. In the drag races, we progressed past the first round to
                be defeated by the “Fastest Loser” in the second round. The team
                dynamic was very healthy and enjoyable. We all learned how to 
                deal with others opinions and criticisms.</p>
